# cerbtk - simple device registry
Just to see how a blockchain approach could solve some fundamental issues. Supposed as PoC, most work was done by Adrian (see credits).

## API

The registration instance is available at http://localhost:23230

As for now, it offers the following endpoints:
* `GET /device` for listing all existing devices in the chain
* `POST /device/write` for adding new device

Device send registration to the chain, gets a block back which is the device ID for all further communication. 
Using a private chain is not tamper proof as an public one, the registration process is just simplified and the 
owner of the chain has the full control.

ToDo:
- include LetsEncrypt certificates
- implement as an k8s service (mesh?)
- add contracting
